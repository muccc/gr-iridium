This module provides blocks to build an Iridium burst detector and demodulator.

It provides a sample application which can be used to detect and demodulate
data from the Iridium satellite network.

You should also have a look at the [iridium-toolkit](https://github.com/muccc/iridium-toolkit).

More information about installing and using gr-iridium can be found in
the [readme](https://github.com/muccc/gr-iridium/blob/master/README.md).
